        Start with the design system to build on the research and experience of
        other service teams and avoid repeating work that's already been done.

        Start with the design system. You donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel. The
        design system is the floor, not the ceiling. Start with it to save time
        building the common parts of a service, so that you can spend time on
        the unique challenges within your service context.
      </GoAContainer>
      <h3>The value of starting with the design system components</h3>
      <p>
        The design system is your foundation for success and an incredible
        time-saver, allowing you to focus on high-value work. By starting with
        the design system, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Streamline collaboration:</strong> Your developers can use the
          corresponding coded design system components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ensure accessibility:</strong> Accessibility is built into the
          components from both design and code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Benefit from thorough testing:</strong> Components have been
          rigorously tested across various devices, browsers, and service
          contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> Components are coordinated with
          the rest of the system for a cohesive experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>More time for other high value work</h3>
      <p>
        Leveraging what exists in the design system saves you time, enabling you
        to spend more time on other high-value tasks such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usability testing</li>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Content design</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Design integrity of the product</li>
        <li>Lo-fidelity design and testing</li>
      </ul>
    </>
