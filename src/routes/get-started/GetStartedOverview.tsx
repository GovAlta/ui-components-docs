          Start with the design system. You donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel. The design system is
          the floor, not the ceiling. Start with it to save time building the common parts of a
          service, so that you can spend time on the unique challenges within your service context.
        </GoAContainer>

        <h3>The value of starting with the design system components</h3>
        <p>
          The design system is your foundation for success and an incredible time-saver, allowing
          you to focus on high-value work. By starting with the design system, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Streamline collaboration:</strong> Your developers can use the corresponding
            coded design system components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure accessibility:</strong> Accessibility is built into the components from
            both design and code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Benefit from thorough testing:</strong> Components have been rigorously tested
            across various devices, browsers, and service contexts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> Components are coordinated with the rest of the
            system for a cohesive experience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>More time for other high value work</h3>
        <p>
          Leveraging what exists in the design system saves you time, enabling you to spend more
          time on other high-value tasks such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usability testing</li>
          <li>User research</li>
          <li>Content design</li>
          <li>Accessibility</li>
          <li>Design integrity of the product</li>
          <li>Lo-fidelity design and testing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
