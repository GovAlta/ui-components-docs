            Start with the design system. You don't need to reinvent the wheel. The design system is
            the floor, not the ceiling. Start with it to save time building the common parts of a
            service, so that you can spend time on the unique challenges within your service
            context.

        The design system can save you time and effort getting to a better service, allowing you to focus on other

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ensure better accessibility:</strong> Accessibility is built into the components from
              both design and code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Save time on testing:</strong> Components have been rigorously tested
              across various devices, browsers, and service contexts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> Components are coordinated with the rest of the

        Start by using the design system <a href={"/components"}> components</a> and <a

        When usability testing shows that a new solution or an improvement to an existing solution is needed, design a
        better solution. Use a 3rd party library, code your own, and/or share solutions with other teams.
