      <h1>DDD Service principles</h1>
      <h3>
        At the DDD, we work as user centred, agile teams to provide better
        digital services to Alberta.
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Nothing for users without users</h2>
          <p>
            We put user needs at the centre of service delivery. Users may
            include Albertans, internal GoA staff, and anyone who has a stake in
            the way that the service is delivered. From the outset of every
            project, we identify and work directly with users to understand
            their experience. Sometimes we map the user service journey to
            identify needs and challenges that users encounter. We continue to
            engage users throughout the whole digital delivery process, testing
            the service with real users, and incorporating our findings.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Collaborative, nimble culture</h2>
          <p>
            Modern service delivery requires modern ways of working. We are
            transforming the Government of Alberta into an organization that can
            deliver world-class digital services. This means shifting the way
            that we work to reduce bureaucracy, empower agile product teams to
            make decisions, increase digital literacy, and inspire
            transformation that endures beyond product delivery.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Quick, iterative and continuous delivery</h2>
          <p>
            We use agile methods to design, develop, test, and iterate possible
            solutions with users. We don't fixate on one potential solution;
            instead, we explore possible ideas with users early and often,
            incorporating findings from usability testing along the way. Our
            priority is to place something of value in the user's hands as
            quickly and as often as possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Open by default</h2>
          <p>
            A modern digital service should be transparent and accountable, both
            to the public and internally among government stakeholders. We are
            open about our process, sharing our work in progress, tools,
            standards, and code freely with Albertans and the broader service
            sector across the country. It also means we communicate openly about
            our successes and failures.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Consider the end to end experience</h2>
          <p>
            We consider the start-to-finish journey users take to complete their
            objective. We endeavour to create a resilient and seamless service
            experience for Albertans across digital and physical channels. In
            some cases, this may include changes to policies and legislation,
            processes, and ways in which users interact with the service.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Flexible technology ecosystem</h2>
          <p>
            We build ecosystems to meet the constant evolution of user needs and
            technology. This means starting small and scaling up, developing
            compatible common components, and judiciously choosing the right
            tool for the job. We believe in being frugal with Albertans' tax
            dollars, and endeavour to leverage existing components of the
            ecosystem wherever possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Resilient security and privacy practices</h2>
          <p>
            We respect that Albertans have entrusted us to handle their personal
            information with care. We recognize that people own their personal
            data and have a stake in how the government uses that information.
            In partnership with the Cybersecurity Services and Data, Information
            and Privacy Services Divisions of Service Alberta, we are committed
            to implementing privacy, security, and data management best
            practices that are in line with industry standards and Albertans'
            evolving expectations of digital services.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Inclusive practices that work for all</h2>
          <p>
            We humbly acknowledge that societal inequities exist and recognize
            that these inequities can—often unintentionally—manifest in an
            organizational setting. We are dedicated to policies and practices
            that strive to mitigate inequities before they happen and confront
            them if they inadvertently arise. We consider accessibility and
            diversity as foundational design criteria for any public service. We
            are committed to designing inclusive government services that
            prioritize the experiences of users with distinct needs. We
            acknowledge the complex historical relationship that the government
            has with Indigenous peoples and endeavour to work in the spirit of
            reconciliation in every project.
