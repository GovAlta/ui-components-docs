      <h3>Digital products built for the Government of Alberta should look to comply with these guidelines to ensure a quality user experience for Albertans.</h3>

      <div className="max-width-72ch">

        <p>
          Usability testing is our preferred method to understand user needs as they relate to each guideline. Suitable usability testing includes:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Users of diverse demographic and behavioural backgrounds that will experience the problem or benefit the product is looking to improve upon.</li>
          <li>Users with varying levels of physical and or cognitive limitations, literacy, and technical capability.</li>
          <li>A diverse range of devices that reflect our users' preferred choice when interacting with government.</li>
          <li>Repeated test cycles as products mature and user needs change over time.</li>
          <li>Testing of complete services end-to-end, not just technology in isolation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>

        <ol>

          <li><strong>Accessible:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be usable for the broadest range of intended users, regardless of physical or cognitive limitations, literacy level, or technical capability.</li>
          <li><strong>Understandable:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be understood by the broadest range of intended users by presenting information in plain language, and reducing cognitive load when it comes to understanding the system and making decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliant:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will align as much as possible to organizational policies such as brand, information management, cyber security, and other Government of Alberta recommended practices.</li>
