      <h3>Digital products built for the Government of Alberta should look to comply with these guidelines to ensure a quality user experience for Albertans.</h3>

      <div className="max-width-72ch">

        <p>
          Usability testing is our preferred method to understand user needs as they relate to each guideline.Suitable usability testing includes:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Users of diverse demographic and behavioural backgrounds that will experience the problem or benefit the product is looking to improve upon.</li>
          <li>Users with varying levels of physical and or cognitive limitations, literacy, and technical capability.</li>
          <li>A diverse range of devices that reflect our users' preferred choice when interacting with government.</li>
          <li>Repeated test cycles as products mature and user needs change over time.</li>
          <li>Testing of complete services end-to-end, not just technology in isolation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Guidelines:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Usable:&nbsp;</strong>Using human-centered design to understand usersâ€™ context of use, goals, tasks, and environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessible:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be usable for the broadest range of users possible regardless of physical 
            or cognitive limitations, literacy level, or technical capability.</li>
          <li><strong>Understandable:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products can be broadly understood by the largest user base possible by presenting 
            information in plain language, absent of organizational speak, industry jargon, and complex legalese.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliant:&nbsp;</strong>The product must leverage the brand and convey authority and legitimacy as a government asset 
            and user expectations of safety and security must be understood and met with experiences that evoke a sense of trust. Digital products 
            will be designed for integration into the broader eco-system of the government reducing the need for new and separate destinations that fracture the experience. </li>
          <li><strong>Iterative:&nbsp;</strong>Products are continuously tested, resourced, and improved upon with users input and usage data to 
            ensure lasting effectiveness, efficiency, and usability. Digital products will offer clearly visible channels for technical support 
            and allow users to submit feedback on product performance, bugs, or suggest improvements. </li>
        </ol>
