      <h1>User experience guidelines</h1>
      <h3>Digital products built for the Government of Alberta should look to comply with these guidelines to ensure a quality user experience for Albertans.</h3>

      <div className="max-width-72ch">

        <p>
          Usability testing is our preferred method to understand user needs as they relate to each guideline. Suitable usability testing includes:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Users of diverse demographic and behavioural backgrounds that will experience the problem or benefit the product is looking to improve upon.</li>
          <li>Users with varying levels of physical and or cognitive limitations, literacy, and technical capability.</li>
          <li>A diverse range of devices that reflect our users' preferred choice when interacting with government.</li>
          <li>Repeated test cycles as products mature and user needs change over time.</li>
          <li>Testing of complete services end-to-end, not just technology in isolation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Guidelines:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Usable:&nbsp;</strong>Using human-centered design to understand usersâ€™ context of use, goals, tasks, and environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern:&nbsp;</strong>Users can achieve their goals and complete tasks in a manner that is on par with digital products 
            used in other aspects of users lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessible:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be usable for the broadest range of users possible regardless of physical 
            or cognitive limitations, literacy level, or technical capability.</li>
          <li><strong>Understandable:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products can be broadly understood by the largest user base possible by presenting 
            information in plain language, absent of organizational speak, industry jargon, and complex legalese.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliant:&nbsp;</strong>The product must leverage the brand and convey authority and legitimacy as a government asset 
            and user expectations of safety and security must be understood and met with experiences that evoke a sense of trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:&nbsp;</strong>Products are continuously tested, resourced, and improved upon with users input and usage data to 
            ensure lasting effectiveness, efficiency, and usability.</li>
        </ol>
