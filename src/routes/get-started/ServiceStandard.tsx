      <h1>User experience standards</h1>
      <h3>User experience standards for digital services at the Government of Alberta.</h3>

      <div className="max-width-72ch">

        <h2>The strategy</h2>
        <p>
          The Digital Design and Delivery’s User Experience Team is beginning the process of establishing 
          a broader User Experience Strategy for the Government of Alberta. This strategy will be focused 
          on the experience delivered to the public and/or staff through design and development of digital 
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of this strategy, resources are available for teams to conduct their own usability testing. 
          The User Experience team is also available for consultation.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Digital experience guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          These guidelines apply to all digital products across government, regardless of delivery method or 
          platform for both public and employee experiences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How do these guidelines relate to other standards and practices?</h3>
        <p>
          When the Government of Alberta begins to redesign or create a new digital service, we employ Service 
          Design principles and methodologies. The Alberta Digital Strategy contains the standards that govern 
          these outcomes. Once a service becomes supported by a digital product (working software), the 
          Experience Guidelines specify quality measures for these digital experiences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Digital products are:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Usable:&nbsp;</strong>Using human-centered design to understand users’ context of use, goals, tasks, and environments</li>
          <li><strong>Suitable:&nbsp;</strong>Users can achieve their goals and complete tasks in a manner that is satisfactory and will be on par 
            with outside modern digital products used in other aspects of users lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessible:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be usable for the broadest range of users possible regardless of physical or 
            cognitive limitations, literacy level, or technical capability.</li>
          <li><strong>Comprehensible:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products are broadly comprehensible by the largest user base possible by presenting 
            information in plain language, absent of organizational speak, industry jargon, and complex legalese.</li>
          <li><strong>Device-agnostic:&nbsp;</strong>Users should not be limited by the device they choose to use or the technology they have 
            access to when interacting with government.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliant:&nbsp;</strong>The product must leverage the brand and convey authority and legitimacy. As a government asset, 
            user expectations of safety and security must be understood and met with experiences that evoke a sense of trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Lean:&nbsp;</strong>Interfaces are designed to be the least amount of function possible to meet the needs of users in 
            a way that feels intuitive and can be operated without the need of outside help.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterative:&nbsp;</strong>Products are continuously tested, resourced, and improved upon with users input and usage data 
            to ensure lasting effectiveness, efficiency, and usability.</li>
          <li><strong>Connected:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will be designed for integration into the broader eco-system of the government 
            reducing the need for new and separate destinations that fracture the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive:&nbsp;</strong>Digital products will make available and clearly visible channels for technical support and 
            allow users to submit feedback on product performance, bugs, or suggest improvements.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Meeting the guidelines through usability testing</h3>
        <p>
          Usability testing is our primary process to ensure we are delivering digital experiences that meet the needs and expectations 
          of users as well as our digital experience guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability testing success will help ensure we design the right product and will be determined by our ability to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recruit a diverse set of users who will experience the problem or benefit the design is looking to improve upon</li>
          <li>Recruit users varying in physical and cognitive limitations, literacy level, or technical capability</li>
          <li>Include the users’ preferred choice of device during testing to understand the diversity of technology used to interact with government</li>
          <li>Test continuously to understand changing needs and expectations as they arise</li>
          <li>Ensure resource availability to act on test findings</li>
          <li>Test entire process not just an application or task in isolation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        
        <h3>User Experience Standards and Review</h3>
        <p>The UX Team has established a Heuristic Self-Evaluation for teams to reference as they begin their usability testing planning
          and implementation. This evaluation will be part of a User Experience Review process that the UX Team will be creating.</p>
        <p>If you haven’t conducted a Heuristic Review before, please reach out to the UX Team for assistance.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are usable.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should focus on understanding user tasks and the efficiency in which users are able to perform actions and reach their goals.</p>
        <p>Requirement: Identification of high priority user tasks and the content required for them to complete their tasks.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are suitable.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should provide an understanding of how our digital product experiences deliver on user expectations 
          compared to other experiences users are familiar with.</p>
        <p>Requirement: Users can easily switch from one task to the next without confusion or frustration. 
          Prompt users to explain or compare similar and preferred digital experiences.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are accessible.</h4>
        <p>Usability test participants should represent the diversity of users within the population the product is looking 
          to serve.</p>
        <p>Requirement: Recruit a diverse set of users varying in physical and cognitive limitations, 
          literacy level, or technical capability within the population who will experience the problem or benefit the design is looking to 
          improve upon, including internal users. Careful consideration has been placed on the diversity and inclusion of usability participants, 
          such as socio-economic background, gender, and race.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are comprehensible.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should include validation that the language and information presented is appropriate to the user and that decisions, 
          tasks, processes, and outcomes are easily understood. Links to other useful and relevant content (for example, related pages, external 
          websites, or documents) are available and shown in context.</p>
        <p>Requirement: prompt users to explain terminology in their own words to validate comprehension on key processes Observing 
          facial and physical reactions help signal areas of confusion, concern or delight and should be probed for more feedback.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are device-agnostic.</h4>
        <p>Usability tests should include a range of devices and assistive technologies to ensure government services will perform in any 
          technology setting users choose to use.</p>
        <p>Requirement: test participants should use their preferred choice of technology during tests and usability research 
          studies should include a range of devices.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are compliant.</h4>
        <p>Usability tests should validate that we understand user needs and preferences around appropriate levels of trust, credibility, 
          security, and privacy within our digital products.</p>
        <p>Requirement: prompt users to describe their feelings, perceptions, or concerns regarding trust, security, and privacy.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are lean.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should be used to validate that enough features are available to meet user needs and that the experience does not 
          include feature bloat making interfaces harder to understand or navigate.</p>
        <p>Requirement: validate not just what features are needed but also what features are not. Features and functionality should 
          only be developed when usability studies show users can easily complete their tasks using the proposed features and functionality.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are iterative.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should be done frequently and aligned to major releases or change in functionality. User needs evolve over time and 
          continuous testing is required to ensure our experiences are keeping up with expectations.</p>
        <p>Requirement: continuous testing and resource availability to act on findings. Tasks are validated and easily actionable 
          on updated designs.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are connected.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should mirror the true end-to-end experience whenever possible so that we can ensure seamless experiences across channels. 
          Features and functionality should support users desired workflows identified in usability testing.</p>
        <p>Requirement: don’t just test the application, test the entire process. Workflows should be visualized with areas of 
          friction and opportunity.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital products are responsive.</h4>
        <p>Usability testing should validate that appropriate support is available within an application to assist users when they need help 
          or want to provide feedback.</p>
        <p>Requirement: support mechanisms should be part of usability test tasks.</p>
